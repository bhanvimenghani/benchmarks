#Running ttm-benchmark using workbench

- Create a workbench with notebook image ‘Standard Data Science’ with `Small` Container size with an accelerate profile.
- Clone Repo: https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm.git
- Download Data set from : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ohGYWWohJlOlb2gsGTeEq3Wii2egnEPR?usp=sharing
	- Upload the two csv’s as : 
	- Create folder “datasets/weather” and “datasets/electricity” in notebooks/hfdemo/tinytimemixer
	- Upload WTH.csv as weather.csv in datasets/weather
	- Upload ETC.csv as electricity.csv in datasets/electricity


## To run the benchmark: 
- Open a terminal window and run `pip install .[notebooks]`
- Go to https://github.com/IBM/tsfm/blob/main/notebooks/hfdemo/tinytimemixer
- Update `list_datasets` to use only    "weather",    "electricity" in both `ttm_benchmarking_512_96.ipynb` and `ttm_benchmarking_1024_96.ipynb`
- Run the ipynb scripts for benchmarking.
